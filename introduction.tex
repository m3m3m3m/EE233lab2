In this lab, we learned how to read and obtain data from integrated circuit component specification sheets through LM148N datasheet, how to do SPICE simulation through Multisim, and the characteristic of operational amplifiers through measuring and analyzing them. \newline
\phantom{ } The characteristic was tested in two sections. In the first section, we experimented the op-amp's characteristic as a voltage follower and compared the testing result with those parameters on the spec. In the second section, we tested the summing amplifier circuit, which is essential for mixing signal channels. We used a speaker and an oscilloscope to display the mixing result, and found out the function of each potentiometer.
