\phantom{ } After finishing all the measurements and analysis, we successfully built the simple audio mixer, and we could adjust the potentiometers to control the volume of each track. We have also discussed why there are a few differences between measured values and values on the spec. The difference structure of the circuit and type of the op-amp are potential reasons.\\
